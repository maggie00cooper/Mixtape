    <h3 id="one">Wake Up Everybody</h3>
    <p>Wake up everybody no more sleepin in bed
      No more backward thinkin time for thinkin ahead
  The world has changed so very much
  From what it used to be so
  There is so much hatred war an' poverty
  Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way
  Maybe then they'll listen to whatcha have to say
  Cause they're the ones who's coming up and the world is in their hands
  When you teach the children teach em the very best you can
  The world won't get no better if we just let it be
  The world won't get no better we gotta change it yeah, just you and me
  Wake up all the doctors make the ol' people well
  They're the ones who suffer an' who catch all the hell
  But they don't have so very long before the Judgement Day
  So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away
  Wake up all the builders time to build a new land
  I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
  The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
  Surely things will work out they do it every time
  The world won't get no better if we just let it be
  The world won't get no better
  We gotta change it yeah, just you and me (yeah, yeah)

    <h3 id="two">Extraordinary Machine</h3>
    <p>I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes
    And
I certainly haven't been spreading myself around
I still only travel by foot
And by foot it's a slow climb
But I'm good at being uncomfortable, so
I can't stop changing all the time

I noticed that my opponent is always on the go
And won't go slow so as not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide
As long as they go fast from whence he came
But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so
He can't stop staying exactly the same

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me
Or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
I'm an extraordinary machine

I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
You deem me doomed to clean my view
And be at peace and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way
And say I've been getting along
For long before you came into the play

I am the baby of the family, it happens
So
Everybody cares
And wear the sheep's clothes while they chaperone
Curious, you're looking down your nose at me
While you appease
Courteous to try and help
But let me set your mind at ease

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me
Or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
I'm an extraordinary machine

Do I so worry you?
No need to hurry to my side
That's very kind
But it's to no avail
I don't want the veil of flowers, no
Everything will be just fine

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me
Or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
I'm an extraordinary machine
</p>

    <h3 id="three">Burial</h3>
    <p>Misery is all we know lately
Saturdays are all the same
Sympathy is overrated
Like a snapshot when you've lost the game
Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both
Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both
No, I
Don't want to get thrown in your ocean
Don't try
You know that we already know it
It's over
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry
At your own burial
Licking up my eighty-first birthday
Every day this body goes to waste
Remembering how I would raise an army
When we went back to your place
Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both
Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both
No, I
Don't want to get thrown in your ocean
Don't try
You know that we already know it
It's over
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry
At your own burial
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry
At your own burial
</p>

    <h3 id="four">Myth</h3>
    <p>Drifting in and out
See the road you're on
You came rolling down the cheek
You say just what you need
And in between
It's never as it seems
Help me to name it
Help me to name it
If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
What comes after this
Momentary bliss
The consequence
Of what you do to me
Help me to name it
Help me to name it
Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows falling from the sun
Can you come?
Would they come to breach you?
Let you know you're not the only one
You can't keep hangin' on
To all that's dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
Do you lie?
Oh, let the ashes fly
Help me to name it
Help me to name it</p>

    <h3 id="five">On Melancholy Hill</h3>
    <p>Up on Melancholy Hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day
Of another dream
Well you can't get what you want
But you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me
So call in the submarines
'Round the world we'll go
Does anybody know, love
If we're looking out on the day
Of another dream?
If you can't get what you want
Then come with me
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits a manatee
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me
When you're close to me
When you're close to me</p>

    <h3 id="six">Kandi</h3>
    <p>You've been my queen for longer than you know
My love for you has been
Every step I take, every day I live, everything I see
And if I get things wrong
Don't want you to think that I'm running away
But I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know
What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
Why? Why? Why did you need him? Where was I?
Just how close to you is he?
Every smile you gave, every touch you made, every word you said
And it hurts beyond hurt
It was a love that blinds and a love that stings
When I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know
What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
Does my love ever touch you?
Does my love ever reach you?
It's never enough, ah, is it never enough?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
I know he called you, baby, baby, all night long
I know he called you, baby, baby, all night long</p>

    <h3  id="seven">Hag</h3>
    <p>Your eyes they have this glowing
You were more than I deserve
After all our shame and suffering
I turned my back to everything I really want
And put you first
Are we really in love, completely in love
Get mention and make your skin start to crawl
Started off living in Brooklyn
It unfolded like a dream
Dazzled by the very thought of it
Like the way dreams are supposed to be
If I'm not what's to come
I will sleep with it
I will carry them on
And we will lose in the end
Only start the whole pattern over again
Over again
Are you truly in love, absolutely in love
You're happy enough
Are you fully in love
If I'm not the point in carrying on
Why spend half the time indifferent
And the other half lone
I will live with my regrets
Learn from mistakes and be done with them
Start the whole thing
Start the whole thing over again</p>

    <h3 id="eight">Big Jet Plane</h3>
    <p>She said, hello mister
Pleased to meet you
I wanna hold her
I wanna kiss her
She smelled of daisies
She smelled of daisies
She drive me crazy
She drive me crazy
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Be my lover
My lady river
Can I take ya
Take ya higher
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Gonna hold ya
Gonna kiss you in my arms
Gonna take ya
Away from harm
Gonna hold ya
Gonna kiss you in my arms
Gonna take ya
Away from harm
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey</p>

    <h3 id="nine">We're Going To Be Friends</h3>
    <p>Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walked to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Yes I can tell that we are gonna be friends</p>

    <h3 id="ten">Fresh Blood</h3>
    <p>Sun down on the sorry day
By nightlights the children pray
I know you're probably gettin' ready for bed
Beautiful woman get out of my head
I'm so tired of the same old crud
Sweet baby I need fresh blood
The moon shines on the autumn sky
Growin' cold the leaves all die
I'm more alone than I've ever been
Help me out of the shape I'm in
After the fires before the flood
My sweet baby I need fresh blood
Whatever trepidation you may feel
In your heart you know it's not real
In a moment of clarity
Some little act of charity
You gotta pull me out of this mud
Sweet baby I need fresh blood
</p>
