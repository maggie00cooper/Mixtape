<h3 id="two">Extraordinary Machine</h3>

    <p>I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes <br>
    And <br>
I certainly haven't been spreading myself around <br>
I still only travel by foot <br>
And by foot it's a slow climb <br>
But I'm good at being uncomfortable, so <br>
I can't stop changing all the time <br>

I noticed that my opponent is always on the go <br>
And won't go slow so as not to focus, and I notice <br>
He'll hitch a ride with any guide <br>
As long as they go fast from whence he  <br>
But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so <br>
He can't stop staying exactly the same <br>

If there was a better way to go then it would find me <br>
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me <br>
Be kind to me <br>
Or treat me mean <br>
I'll make the most of it <br>
I'm an extraordinary machine <br>

I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day <br>
You deem me doomed to clean my view  <br>
And be at peace and lay <br>
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way <br>
And say I've been getting along  <br>
For long before you came into the play  <br>

I am the baby of the family, it happens <br>
So <br>
Everybody cares <br>
And wear the sheep's clothes while they chaperone <br>
Curious, you're looking down your nose at me <br>
While you appease <br>
Courteous to try and help <br>
But let me set your mind at ease <br>

If there was a better way to go then it would find me <br>
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me <br>
Be kind to me <br>
Or treat me mean <br>
I'll make the most of it <br>
I'm an extraordinary machine <br>

Do I so worry you? <br>
No need to hurry to my side <br>
That's very kind <br>
But it's to no avail <br>
I don't want the veil of flowers, no <br>
Everything will be just fine <br>

If there was a better way to go then it would find me <br>
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me <br>
Be kind to me <br>
Or treat me mean <br>
I'll make the most of it <br>
I'm an extraordinary machine <br>

    <p>Misery is all we know lately <br>
Saturdays are all the same <br>
Sympathy is overrated <br>
Like a snapshot when you've lost the game <br>
Now it's all the funeral <br>
I've become a serial <br>
Killer of us both <br>
Now it's all the funeral <br>
I've become a serial <br>
Killer of us both <br>
No, I <br>
Don't want to get thrown in your ocean <br>
Don't try <br>
You know that we already know it <br>
It's over <br>
At your own burial <br>
Don't forget to cry <br>
At your own burial <br>
Licking up my eighty-first birthday  <br>
Every day this body goes to waste <br>
Remembering how I would raise an army <br>
When we went back to your place <br>
Now it's all the funeral <br>
I've become a serial <br>
Killer of us both <br>
Now it's all the funeral <br>
I've become a serial <br>
Killer of us both <br>
No, I <br>
Don't want to get thrown in your ocean <br>
Don't try <br>
You know that we already know it <br>
It's over <br>
At your own burial <br>
Don't forget to cry <br>
At your own burial <br>
At your own burial <br>
Don't forget to cry <br>
At your own burial <br>

    <p>Drifting in and out <br>
See the road you're on <br>
You came rolling down the cheek <br>
You say just what you need <br>
And in between <br>
It's never as it seems <br>
Help me to name it <br>
Help me to name it <br>
If you built yourself a myth <br>
You'd know just what to give <br>
What comes after this <br>
Momentary bliss <br>
The consequence <br>
Of what you do to me <br>
Help me to name it <br>
Help me to name it <br>
Found yourself in a new direction <br>
Arrows falling from the sun <br>
Can you come? <br>
Would they come to breach you? <br>
Let you know you're not the only one <br>
You can't keep hangin' on <br>
To all that's dead and gone <br>
If you built yourself a myth <br>
You'd know just what to give <br>
Do you lie? <br>
Oh, let the ashes fly <br>
Help me to name it <br>
Help me to name it</p>

    <p>Up on Melancholy Hill <br>
There's a plastic tree <br>
Are you here with me? <br>
Just looking out on the day <br>
Of another dream <br>
Well you can't get what you want <br>
But you can get me <br>
So let's set out to sea, love <br>
'Cause you are my medicine <br>
When you're close to me <br>
When you're close to me <br>
So call in the submarines <br>
'Round the world we'll go <br>
Does anybody know, love <br>
If we're looking out on the day <br>
Of another dream? <br>
If you can't get what you want <br>
Then come with me <br>
Up on Melancholy Hill <br>
Sits a manatee <br>
Just looking out for the day <br>
When you're close to me <br>
When you're close to me <br>
When you're close to me</p>

    <p>You've been my queen for longer than you know <br>
My love for you has been <br>
Every step I take, every day I live, everything I see <br>
And if I get things wrong <br>
Don't want you to think that I'm running away <br>
But I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know <br>
What did he say? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
What did he do? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
Why? Why? Why did you need him? Where was I? <br>
Just how close to you is he?  <br>
Every smile you gave, every touch you made, every word you said <br>
And it hurts beyond hurt <br>
It was a love that blinds and a love that stings <br>
When I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know <br>
What did he say? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
What did he do? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
What did he say? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
Does my love ever touch you? <br>
Does my love ever reach you? <br>
It's never enough, ah, is it never enough? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
What did he do? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
What did he say? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
What did he do? <br>
He called me baby, baby, all night long <br>
I know he called you, baby, baby, all night long <br>
I know he called you, baby, baby, all night long</p>

    <p>Your eyes they have this glowing <br>
You were more than I deserve <br>
After all our shame and suffering <br>
I turned my back to everything I really want <br>
And put you first <br>
Are we really in love, completely in love <br>
Get mention and make your skin start to crawl <br>
Started off living in Brooklyn <br>
It unfolded like a dream <br>
Dazzled by the very thought of it <br>
Like the way dreams are supposed to be <br>
If I'm not what's to come <br>
I will sleep with it <br>
I will carry them on <br>
And we will lose in the end <br>
Only start the whole pattern over again <br>
Over again <br>
Are you truly in love, absolutely in love <br>
You're happy enough <br>
Are you fully in love <br>
If I'm not the point in carrying on <br>
Why spend half the time indifferent <br>
And the other half lone <br>
I will live with my regrets <br>
Learn from mistakes and be done with them <br>
Start the whole thing <br>
Start the whole thing over again</p>

    <p>Fall is here, hear the yell <br>
Back to school, ring the bell <br>
Brand new shoes, walking blues <br>
Climb the fence, books and pens <br>
I can tell that we are gonna be friends <br>
I can tell that we are gonna be friends <br>

Walk with me, Suzy Lee <br>
Through the park and by the tree <br>
We will rest upon the ground <br>
And look at all the bugs we found <br>
Safely walk to school without a sound <br>
Safely walk to school without a sound <br>

Here we are, no one else <br>
We walked to school all by ourselves <br>
There's dirt on our uniforms <br>
From chasing all the ants and worms <br>
We clean up and now it's time to learn <br>
We clean up and now it's time to learn <br>

Numbers, letters, learn to spell <br>
Nouns, and books, and show and tell <br>
Playtime we will throw the ball <br>
Back to class, through the hall <br>
Teacher marks our height against the wall <br>
Teacher marks our height against the wall <br>

We don't notice any time pass <br>
We don't notice anything <br>
We sit side by side in every class <br>
Teacher thinks that I sound funny <br>
But she likes the way you sing <br>

Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed <br>
When silly thoughts go through my head <br>
About the bugs and alphabet <br>
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet <br>
That you and I will walk together again <br>
I can tell that we are gonna be friends <br>
Yes I can tell that we are gonna be friends</p>

    <p>Sun down on the sorry day <br>
By nightlights the children pray <br>
I know you're probably gettin' ready for bed <br>
Beautiful woman get out of my head <br>
I'm so tired of the same old crud <br>
Sweet baby I need fresh blood <br>
The moon shines on the autumn sky <br>
Growin' cold the leaves all die <br>
I'm more alone than I've ever been <br>
Help me out of the shape I'm in <br>
After the fires before the flood <br>
My sweet baby I need fresh blood <br>
Whatever trepidation you may feel <br>
In your heart you know it's not real <br>
In a moment of clarity  <br>
Some little act of charity <br>
You gotta pull me out of this mud <br>
Sweet baby I need fresh blood
